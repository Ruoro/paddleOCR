# Optical Character Recognition.
Implementing optical character recognition using PaddleOCR

## Introduction
The PaddleOCR repository is from baidu servers. The model has been extensic=vely trained on different types of images and can therefore extract text from different types of images eg, prescription bottles, number plates, memes etc. For this project i was trying to impliment an ocr model that could properly detect images from memes in hopes of finding a good database for getting down to toxic memes. 

## Getting Started
install the PaddleOCR using the following code

!python3 -m pip install paddlepaddle-gpu -i https://mirror.baidu.com/pypi/simple

one also has to clone the github repo in order to use the fonts in the final display

!git clone https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR


Then one has to make the neccecarry imports eg.
> cv2
> matplotlib
> PaddleOCR
> os

### Prerequisites
The only prerequisite is a jupyter notebook or a google collab.

## Contributing
